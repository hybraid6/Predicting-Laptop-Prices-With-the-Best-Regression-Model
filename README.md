# Laptop Price Prediction Project

## Overview

This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine-learning project aimed at predicting laptop prices. The project leverages various regression techniques and advanced data preprocessing methods to develop accurate and interpretable models.

## Key Features

- **Predictive Models:** Explored and implemented linear regression, Lasso regression, Ridge regression, and Elastic Net regression to predict laptop prices.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Conducted thorough data exploration, cleaning, and feature engineering to optimize the dataset for modelling.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Utilized performance metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared to assess model accuracy.
- **Model Comparison:** Compared and evaluated different regression models to identify the most suitable for predicting laptop prices.
- **Insights and Recommendations:** Provided key insights and recommendations based on the analysis, contributing to a better understanding of factors influencing laptop prices.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/muhammetvarl/laptop-price) and includes information on laptop specifications, brands, and pricing. It comprises 1320 rows with features like screen size, CPU details, RAM, storage information, GPU, operating system, weight, and price in euros.

## Results

The project achieved promising results with the best model yielding an RMSE of 0.492. Further improvements could be explored by incorporating polynomial features and refining the dataset.
